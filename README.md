# JavaScript Calculator Application

📝 This is an attempt to make a calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to include in my portfolio.

🛠 Feautures include selecting from a variety of different calculator designs and customising the colour of the calculator.

✍️ There will also be a toggle which will allow the user to log their calculations to a list with the ability to rename each entry. These logged calculations can be deleted or selected for further use.

👀 DEMO: You can view the progress on this project here.
